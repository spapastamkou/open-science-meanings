## The multiple facets of open science

* Ethical 
* Scientific
* Economic 
* Political
* Social
* Institutional
* Technical

(See open call: *Open Science as an Object of Research: Methods, Ethics, and Epistemology*, SCIROS workshop, Marseille, OpenEdition Lab, 23-24 September 2025)

OS: "an umbrella term for a programme of reforming science by reforming scholarly communication, with a clearly normative thrust (i.e. to make science better)." (Reichmann & Wieser 2020). The authors notice that frequently OS is used interchangeably with the terms OA and open data.   

### A genealogical approach of OS as openness and accessibility

Moore 2017 takes a genealogical approach, inspired by Foucault, to examine different discourses on openness and access to scholarship. *This article focuses on OA rather than OS.*  

Considers OS from a social (=community) perspective and insists on its dynamic dimension:  "One should not think of OA as a thing-in-itself; rather, it should be seen as a  process of understanding, engaging and experimenting with the ways in which research is presented and disseminated. OA should therefore be considered and fostered as a community-led initiative"

Distinguishes two lineages influenced by:
1. Cost-free access to research works (institutional or subject repositories, early OA journals on the web) => focus in **access**
2. Open source software (new types of digital born scientific journals, open licences) => focus on **openness**

Openness: 
decentralized/distributed, associated to (neo)liberal approaches of economy and free market, individualized; but also localized to collective worker-owned approaches => antagonistic political approaches and recuperations of openness 

Caracter of boundary object: multiple approaches and individualized understandings/praxis but also a common shared domain

Access: 
emphasis on cost-free accessibility => repositories


### Five schools of thought 
Fecher & Friesike 2014 identify a diversity / ambiguity in the discourse on open science after reviewing relevant literature scholarly publications, scientific blogs, newspapers) up to that date (roughly, ten years ago). They distinguish five distinct schools of thought.

1. Public school
2. Democratic school
3. Pragmatic school
4. Infrastructure school
5. Measurement school

#### Public school
Focus: access (through participatory practices and shared authority)
Means: web technologies
Goal: Open science to the publics (citizen science)

#### Democratic school
Focus: access to research data and scientific publications
Open data and OA movements
Repositories

#### Pragmatic school
Focus: make research more efficient 
Open innovation related
Web technologies, collaborative tools (*the notion of tool is very present in this segment of literature*)

#### Infrastructure school
Focus: technical infrastructure: software tools, applications, informations systems, networks
Practice, case-specificity
Distributed computing
Social and collaboration networks for scientists

#### Measurement school
Focus: impact measurement (=> research evaluation) through altmetrics

## Ngram of the term

We notice that the term becomes more frequent from the mid-2000s onwards and especially since the mid-2010s (the peak starting around 2013-2015).
