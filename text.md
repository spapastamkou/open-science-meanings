## The multiple facets of open science

* Ethical 
* Scientific
* Economic 
* Political
* Social
* Institutional
* Technical

(See open call: *Open Science as an Object of Research: Methods, Ethics, and Epistemology*, SCIROS workshop, Marseille, OpenEdition Lab, 23-24 September 2025)

OS: "an umbrella term for a programme of reforming science by reforming scholarly communication, with a clearly normative thrust (i.e. to make science better)." (Reichmann & Wieser 2020). The authors notice that frequently OS is used interchangeably with the terms OA and open data.   

### A genealogical approach of OS as openness and accessibility

Moore 2017 takes a genealogical approach, inspired by Foucault, to examine different discourses on openness and access to scholarship. *This article focuses on OA rather than OS.*  

Considers OS from a social (=community) perspective and insists on its dynamic dimension:  "One should not think of OA as a thing-in-itself; rather, it should be seen as a  process of understanding, engaging and experimenting with the ways in which research is presented and disseminated. OA should therefore be considered and fostered as a community-led initiative"

Distinguishes two lineages influenced by:
1. Cost-free access to research works (institutional or subject repositories, early OA journals on the web) => focus in **access**
2. Open source software (new types of digital born scientific journals, open licences) => focus on **openness**

Openness: 
decentralized/distributed, associated to (neo)liberal approaches of economy and free market, individualized; but also localized to collective worker-owned approaches => antagonistic political approaches and recuperations of openness 

Caracter of boundary object: multiple approaches and individualized understandings/praxis but also a common shared domain

Access: 
emphasis on cost-free accessibility => repositories


### Five schools of thought 
Fecher & Friesike 2014 identify a diversity / ambiguity in the discourse on open science after reviewing relevant literature scholarly publications, scientific blogs, newspapers) up to that date (roughly, ten years ago). They distinguish five distinct schools of thought.

1. Public school
2. Democratic school
3. Pragmatic school
4. Infrastructure school
5. Measurement school

#### Public school
Focus: access (through participatory practices and shared authority)
Means: web technologies
Goal: Open science to the publics (citizen science)

#### Democratic school
Focus: access to research data and scientific publications
Open data and OA movements
Repositories

#### Pragmatic school
Focus: make research more efficient 
Open innovation related
Web technologies, collaborative tools (*the notion of tool is very present in this segment of literature*)

#### Infrastructure school
Focus: technical infrastructure: software tools, applications, informations systems, networks
Practice, case-specificity
Distributed computing
Social and collaboration networks for scientists

#### Measurement school
Focus: impact measurement (=> research evaluation) through altmetrics

## Ngram of the term

We notice that the term becomes more frequent from the mid-2000s onwards and especially since the mid-2010s (the peak starting around 2013-2015).

 > "'Open Science' is one of the buzzwords of the scientific community". (Fecher & Friesike 2014) 

 ### The politics/policies of OS

 Keohane & Nye consider scientific information as part of free information (the two other categories being commercial and strategic), e.g. information to be acquired (by a receiver) or made available (by the sender) for free. The sender gets advantages from the receiver using the information which is an incentive to produce it. As capacity to attract attention to the information they produce. The information revolution increases the number of channels of communication in world politics among individuals in networks (not only in bureaucracies). Which adds a layer in the existing patterns on complex interdependence at a global level. (Keohane & Nye 2012).

 Knowledge as power (behavioural vs resource power: behavioural = hard/soft power) 

 "Soft power, on the other hand, is the ability to get desired outcomes because others
want what you want; it is the ability to achieve desired outcomes through attraction
rather than coercion. It works by convincing others to follow or getting them to agree
to norms and institutions that produce the desired behavior. Soft power can rest on the
appeal of one’s ideas or culture or the ability to set the agenda through standards and
institutions that shape the preferences of others. It depends largely on the persuasiveness
of the free information that an actor seeks to transmit. If a state can make its power
legitimate in the eyes of others and establish international institutions that encourage
others to define their interests in compatible ways, it may not need to expend as many
of its costly traditional economic or military resources." (Keohane & Nye 2012, p. 216).

Some aspects of the information revolution help the small, but some help
the already large and powerful. 
first movers are often the creators of the standards and architecture of
information systems. The path dependent development of such systems reflects the
advantage of the first mover. The use of the English language and the pattern of top-level domain names on the Internet provide relevant examples. Partly because
of the transformation of the American economy in the 1980s (which was missed or
misunderstood by the prophets of decline) and partly because of large investments
driven by the Cold War military competition, the United States was often the first
mover and still enjoys a lead in the application of a wide variety of information
technologies. (Keohane & Nye 2012, p. 217-218)

### UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021 
Open science is **a set of principles and practices** that aim to make scientific research from all fields **accessible** to everyone for the benefits of **scientists and society** as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is *
**inclusive, equitable and sustainable**.

Values

* Quality and integrity
* Collective benefit
* Equity and fairness
* Diversity and inclusiveness

Principles

* Transparency, scrutiny, critique and reproducibility (scientific results)
* Equality of opportunities (for all scientists and those with an interest in science) 
* Responsibility, respect and accountability (public accountability, potential conflicts of interest, intellectual integrity, possible social or ecological consequences of research activities)
* Collaboration, participation and inclusion (across boundaries of geography, language and resources, including knowledge from marginalized communities)
* Flexibility (different pathways to practicing OS) 
* Sustainability (long-term practices, services, infrastructures and funding models) 


### UNESCO OS Outlook1, 2023

The COVID-19 pandemic impact: more than 85 per cent of articles on COVID-19 were open access by mid-2021, compared to 40 per cent of academic articles normally, allowing science to make great breakthroughs in record time.

#### Key messages of the report

1. OS as access to scientific knowledge for the benefit of science and society (inclusion, reproducibility, sharing, innovation)
2. OS as a (potential) truly global equitable phenomenon
3. Rapid growth of existing OS practices around the world and across disciplines - need to adapt the OS methods of assessment (open quali/quanti evaluation, shift from publications/outputs to impact, values, people) 
    Some interesting quantitative information in this section: 
    * In general, the number of scientific publications in open access, collaborative research platforms, open repositories, open source software and hardware is increasing but with differences across disciplines and regions.
    * Only a third of all scientific literature published between 2000 and 2021 is in open access, based on indexing in openly available bibliometric databases. The trend is positive: half of scientific articles published in 2021 were released in some form of open access.
    * Open science infrastructures now number in the thousands, increasing the need for interoperability and attention to their sustainability.
