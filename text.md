## What is OS?


### The multiple facets of open science

* Ethical 
* Scientific
* Economic 
* Political
* Social
* Institutional
* Technical

(See open call: *Open Science as an Object of Research: Methods, Ethics, and Epistemology*, SCIROS workshop, Marseille, OpenEdition Lab, 23-24 September 2025)

### Functional definitions

OS: "an umbrella term for a programme of reforming science by reforming scholarly communication, with a clearly normative thrust (i.e. to make science better)." (Reichmann & Wieser 2020). <!--The authors notice that frequently OS is used interchangeably with the terms OA and open data.--> 

Open science is the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society." It can be defined as a grouping of **principles** and **practices** ([FOSTER taxonomy definition](https://github.com/Open-Science-Training-Handbook/Open-Science-Training-Handbook_EN/tree/1.1/01Introduction#what-is-open-science)).

Principles

"Open Science is about increased transparency, re-use, participation, cooperation, accountability and reproducibility for research. It aims to improve the quality and reliability of research through principles like inclusion, fairness, equity, and sharing."

Practices

Open access to research publications, data-sharing, open notebooks, transparency in research evaluation, ensuring the reproducibility of research (where possible), transparency in research methods, open source code, software and infrastructure, citizen science and open educational resources. 

See GitBook Bot et al. *Open Science Training Handbook*. Zenodo, 4 April 2018. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1212538.

### A genealogical approach of OS as openness and accessibility

Moore 2017 takes a genealogical approach, inspired by Foucault, to examine different discourses on openness and access to scholarship. *This article focuses on OA rather than OS.* 

Considers OS from a **social (=community) perspective** and insists on its **dynamic dimension**: "One should not think of OA as a thing-in-itself; rather, it should be seen as **a process** of understanding, engaging and experimenting with the ways in which research is presented and disseminated. OA should therefore be considered and fostered as a **community-led initiative**"

Distinguishes two lineages influenced by:
1. Cost-free access to research works (institutional or subject repositories, early OA journals on the web) => focus in **access**
2. Open source software (new types of digital born scientific journals, open licences) => focus on **openness**

Openness: 
decentralized/distributed, associated to (neo)liberal approaches of economy and free market, individualized; but also localized to collective worker-owned approaches => antagonistic political approaches and recuperations of openness 


Access: 
emphasis on cost-free accessibility => repositories

==> OS as boundary object: multiple approaches and individualized understandings/praxis but also a common shared domain


### Five schools of thought 
Fecher & Friesike 2014 identify a diversity / ambiguity in the discourse on open science after reviewing relevant literature scholarly publications, scientific blogs, newspapers up to that date (roughly, ten years ago). They distinguish five distinct schools of thought.

1. Public school
2. Democratic school
3. Pragmatic school
4. Infrastructure school
5. Measurement school

![5 schools of thought on Open Science](/images/five-schools-of-os-2025-09-17.png "5 schools of thought on Open Science as per Fecher & Friesike 2014")

#### Public school
Focus: access (through participatory practices and shared authority)

Means: web technologies

Goal: Open science to the publics (citizen science)

#### Democratic school
Focus: access to research data and scientific publications

Open data and OA movements

Repositories

#### Pragmatic school
Focus: make research more efficient 

Open innovation related

Web technologies, collaborative tools (*the notion of tool is very present in this segment of literature*)

#### Infrastructure school
Focus: technical infrastructure: software tools, applications, informations systems, networks

Practice, case-specificity

Distributed computing

Social and collaboration networks for scientists

#### Measurement school
Focus: impact measurement (=> research evaluation) through altmetrics

## Ngram of the term
Quantitative evolution of the term Open Science (case-insensitive) in the corpus of Google Books (1800-2022, English language. 
<!--

</html>
-->

We notice that the term becomes more frequent from the mid-2000s onwards and especially since the mid-2010s (the peak starting around 2013-2015).

 > "'Open Science' is one of the buzzwords of the scientific community". (Fecher & Friesike 2014) 

 ## The emergence of the OA movement (?)

 <!--*Can we call it a movement?*--> 
 A structural need: communication across scientific communities 

 A conjuncture: Phenomena of concentration of the activity in the international scientific publication market, exponential growth of the prices of the subscriptions to scientific journals (1975-1995: +200-300%, as per Dewatripont *et al.* 2006) 

 A technological disruption: web technologies 1990s, 2000s

 ==> empowerement of (individual actors in the) scientific communities, decentralized publication, + activation of institutional actors

* Santa Fe Convention, Open Archives Initiative,S NM (1999)
* Budapest Declaration (2002, Open Society Institute): theoretical framework for OA

* Berlin Declaration (2003, Institut Max Planck), Berlin 3 (2005)
  
## The politics/policies of OS

* European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (2002); roadmap for a policy on OA (2006) 
* Recommandation of the European Commission (2012): OA = one of the principles of H2020
* H2020: obligation to make openly accessible research publications - incitation to disseminate research data (obligation of OA for pilot projects Open Research Data)

### First legislations on OA 

* 2011: Spain
* 2012: UK gvt engages in favor of OA
* 2013: Germany, Italy
* 2014: Denmark, Netherlands
* 2016: Loi pour une République numérique, France

### OS as modus operandi for the European research

#### European Research Area (ERA), 2000

==> aim: create ["a single market for research and innovation fostering free movement of researchers, scientific knowledge and innovation, and fostering a more competitive European industry"](https://european-research-area.ec.europa.eu/era-history). 

Priorities: access to research publications and data, research infrastructures

#### From OA to OS
Carlos Moeda (commissioner for research, innovation and science, 2014-2019): approach of 3 Os:

* Open Innovation
* Open Science 
* Open to the world 

#### (Open) Science as Commons 

* Open Science and notion of commons: 2013 European e-Infrastructure Reflection Group (e-IRG), White Paper, 2013
* “La connaissance est un bien commun de l’humanité et […] les données de la
science doivent être érigées en données d’intérêt général” CPU, October 2015

* “La science est un bien commun qui doit profiter à tous” F. VIdal, 2 April 2019

#### Plan S 

Plan S: an initiative for Open Access publishing, launched in September 2018 by cOAlition S (international consortium of research funding and performing organisations).

Aim of plan S: "from 2021, scientific publications that result from research funded by public grants must be published in compliant Open Access journals or platforms".

### Scientific information and soft power

Keohane & Nye consider scientific information as part of free information (the two other categories being commercial and strategic), e.g. information to be acquired (by a receiver) or made available (by the sender) for free. The sender gets advantages from the receiver using the information which is an incentive to produce it. As capacity to attract attention to the information they produce. The information revolution increases the number of channels of communication in world politics among individuals in networks (not only in bureaucracies). Which adds a layer in the existing patterns on complex interdependence at a global level. (Keohane & Nye 2012).

Knowledge as power (behavioural vs resource power: behavioural = hard/soft power) 

"Soft power, on the other hand, is the ability to get desired outcomes because others
want what you want; it is the ability to achieve desired outcomes through attraction
rather than coercion. It works by convincing others to follow or getting them to agree
to norms and institutions that produce the desired behavior. Soft power can rest on the
appeal of one’s ideas or culture or the ability to set the agenda through standards and
institutions that shape the preferences of others. It depends largely on the persuasiveness
of the free information that an actor seeks to transmit. If a state can make its power
legitimate in the eyes of others and establish international institutions that encourage
others to define their interests in compatible ways, it may not need to expend as many
of its costly traditional economic or military resources." (Keohane & Nye 2012, p. 216).

Some aspects of the information revolution help the small, but some help the already large and powerful. 
First movers are often the creators of the standards and architecture of
information systems. The path dependent development of such systems reflects the
advantage of the first mover. The use of the English language and the pattern of top-level domain names on the Internet provide relevant examples. Partly because of the transformation of the American economy in the 1980s (which was missed or misunderstood by the prophets of decline) and partly because of large investments driven by the Cold War military competition, the United States was often the first mover and still enjoys a lead in the application of a wide variety of information technologies. (Keohane & Nye 2012, p. 217-218)

### UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021 
Open science is **a set of principles and practices** that aim to make scientific research from all fields **accessible** to everyone for the benefits of **scientists and society** as a whole. Open science is about making sure not only that scientific knowledge is accessible but also that the production of that knowledge itself is **inclusive, equitable and sustainable**.

Values

* Quality and integrity
* Collective benefit
* Equity and fairness
* Diversity and inclusiveness

Principles

* Transparency, scrutiny, critique and reproducibility (scientific results)
* Equality of opportunities (for all scientists and those with an interest in science) 
* Responsibility, respect and accountability (public accountability, potential conflicts of interest, intellectual integrity, possible social or ecological consequences of research activities)
* Collaboration, participation and inclusion (across boundaries of geography, language and resources, including knowledge from marginalized communities)
* Flexibility (different pathways to practicing OS) 
* Sustainability (long-term practices, services, infrastructures and funding models)

### UNESCO OS Outlook 1, 2023

The COVID-19 pandemic impact: more than 85 per cent of articles on COVID-19 were open access by mid-2021, compared to 40 per cent of academic articles normally, allowing science to make great breakthroughs in record time.

#### Key messages of the report

1. OS as access to scientific knowledge for the benefit of science and society (inclusion, reproducibility, sharing, innovation)
2. OS as a (potential) truly global equitable phenomenon
3. Rapid growth of existing OS practices around the world and across disciplines - need to adapt the OS methods of assessment (open quali/quanti evaluation, shift from publications/outputs to impact, values, people) 
    Some interesting quantitative information in this section: 
    * In general, the number of scientific publications in open access, collaborative research platforms, open repositories, open source software and hardware is increasing but with differences across disciplines and regions.
    * Only a third of all scientific literature published between 2000 and 2021 is in open access, based on indexing in openly available bibliometric databases. The trend is positive: half of scientific articles published in 2021 were released in some form of open access.
    * Open science infrastructures now number in the thousands, increasing the need for interoperability and attention to their sustainability.
4. OS requires a shift in the culture of science (aligned funding & policies, consideration of local specific contexts, monitoring of impact)
5. OS requires investment
